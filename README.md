# ShadeSync

## Project Description
ShadeSync is an ongoing project aimed at creating a smarter, more convenient way to manage window shades. The idea is to explore how automation and simple technology can improve daily routines, from better sleep at night to easier wake-ups in the morning. Our vision is to design a system that feels natural, reliable, and helpful — one that blends into everyday life and makes it just a little smoother.  

## Technology Stack
Drawing from our project design document, ShadeSync will use a combination of hardware and software to support automation, scheduling, and user interaction:  
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 (for control, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity)  
- **Control Logic:** Scripts to handle shade movement and scheduling routines  
- **Timekeeping:** RTC module or network time sync for reliable scheduling  
- **User Interface:** Android companion app for setup, scheduling, and manual control  
- **Input/Feedback:** Limit switches or encoders for shade positioning, with optional sensors for future features  

## Set Up and Run the Project Locally
This project is still under development, and setup instructions may change as it evolves. In general, the process will include:  
1. Cloning the repository from GitHub.  
2. Opening the project in a development environment.  
3. Uploading the code to the microcontroller or running the app on a device.  
4. Testing and adjusting features as new components are added.  

## Team Members
- Matthew Dauria  
- Brian Quintero  
- Jake Sussner  

**Roles:** Collaborative Development — all team members contribute equally to every part of the project.  

## Unique Contributions
- **Matthew Dauria** – Experience with artificial intelligence, especially in automation, non-playable characters for games, and data tracking.  
- **Brian Quintero** – Background in encrypted equipment, RF signals, PIR sensors, and remote-control systems.  
- **Jake Sussner** – Strong troubleshooting skills in both code and mechanics, with the ability to quickly identify and resolve errors.  

**Note:** While each member brings different skills to the table, we are teaching each other these areas of expertise throughout the project so everyone gains well-rounded knowledge.
